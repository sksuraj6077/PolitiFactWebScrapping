It removes money as a factor in determining whether a suspect can be released while awaiting trial.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe new law did not create “nondetainable” offenses. Prosecutors can still petition judges to detain suspects, and must provide evidence to prove the suspects are a public safety threat or flight risk.\\n\\n\\nAll of the crimes listed in a Facebook post could result in a suspect being detained until trial.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nAdam Kinzinger said Trump had won the “Trump versus Kinzinger war” over the soul of the Republican Party. He didn’t say Trump won the election.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n', '\\n\\nR. Kelly didn’t escape prison. He was recently moved from a federal detention facility in New York to one in Chicago where he awaits another criminal trial.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n', '\\n\\n\\nRobert Crimo III, who opened fire during an Independence Day celebration in Highland Park, Illinois, had a history of encounters with local police, but was not barred from legally purchasing weapons.\\n\\n\\nInvestigators told news outlets that Crimo obtained the proper identification needed to legally purchase firearms and passed several background checks before buying his weapons legally.\\n\\n\\nNeither law enforcement officials nor the shooter’s family members used the state’s red flag law and petitioned to prevent him from acquiring guns.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\nNone of the images supposedly pulled from Crimo’s social media feeds have been verified and the evidence supporting their authenticity is thin.\\n\\n\\nScreenshots of Crimo’s supposed Instagram account omitted information, such as a username, that could have been used to verify it.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nThis claim is baseless. The shooting suspect has confessed, authorities said, and witnesses have told reporters what they saw.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n', '\\n\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shared an image featuring the Highland Park shooting suspect, falsely claiming it was a photo that showed him “in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe image is noticeably edited; one expert said it contains “clear signs of manipulation.”\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Illinois high school administrators are not grading students based on their race\\n\\n\\nAdministrators are working to develop an approach for equitable grading, though it will rely on objective assessments of whether students have mastered the material.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWest Cook News, the source of this claim,\\xa0is part of a group of websites that has taken funding from conservative groups.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nChicago is frequently targeted as a city with ineffective, strict gun laws. While the city has a history of implementing tougher laws in comparison to other cities, Supreme Court decisions drastically loosened some restrictions.\\nThis claim does not take into consideration how loose\\xa0gun laws in certain states impact neighboring states with strict laws.\\xa0\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\xa0In his bid for Congress, Mayor Keith Pekau is touting the downward turn in reported crimes during his tenure. While the reported statistics bear him out, there was a spike in violent crime his first year in office.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\nThe sources Rep. Mary Miller used to back her claim that the White House is encouraging children to take chemical castration drugs and undergo surgeries fall short.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSeveral medical organizations support the use of hormonal treatments for children who — with medical consultation — decide to delay puberty.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost credible scientific studies show the effects of puberty blockers are reversible.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nThe U.S. Senator\\xa0joins a growing number of Democratic politicians who have incorrectly cited a national study of the gender pay gap to include an analysis of men and women in the same job. It doesn’t.\\nPolitiFact has long fact-checked claims on the gender pay gap and found that elected officials frequently misinterpret the data behind Equal Pay Day.\\xa0\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\nAurora Mayor Richard Irvin in a tweet last month claimed he reduced homicides by 40% during his first year in office. Experts say using percentages instead of actual numbers to describe crime trends is misleading.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nState Rep. Blaine Wilhour said there is absolutely no observed or clinical data to indicate any benefit to masking K-12 students. No clinical data is available to date, but a health expert says there is plenty of observational data out there.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nGov. Pritzker said “a larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated,” compared to the rest of the Midwest. That's mostly true but when it comes to those who are fully vaccinated, Minnesota is the region's top performer.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nWe compared data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Chicago's 2021 unemployment rates did not even rank lowest among the four largest cities, which includes\\xa0Houston,\\xa0 Los Angeles and New York City.\\xa0\\nWhen we analyzed only areas within city limits, Houston's unemployment rate was better than Chicago's every month, January through November.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\nMinneapolis has nearly 430,000 residents, while the highest estimate we could find for the group of migrants leaving Tapachula was\\xa04,000 — just under 1% of that total.\\n\\n\\nMiller did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nBryant did not respond to our inquiries asking for evidence to back up her claim, and we could find no surveys or studies that show she is correct.\\xa0\\nThe figure Bryant cited is higher than Illinois’ overall vaccination rate even though counties that voted for Trump in 2020 have a lower\\xa0vaccination rate on average than counties that Biden won, state data show.\\nHer figure is also out of line with multiple national surveys conducted over the past two months that find Republicans are one of the demographic groups least likely to have taken the vaccine.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nChicago's 1995 heat wave spanned multiple days, making it impossible to compare the event to more sudden tragedies, many of which also killed more people. Casten’s office told us the congressman was mistaken in this comparison.\\n\\n\\nStudies do predict extreme heat\\xa0will become more frequent in Chicago due to climate change. If significant actions are not taken to reduce global emissions, the city could face a\\xa0heat wave like the one from 1995\\xa0every year.\\n\\n\\nBut Chicago might still avoid such extreme annual heat events if\\xa0emissions are lowered,\\xa0and even under a higher-emissions\\xa0scenario 1995-like heat waves\\xa0would not become as\\xa0frequent as Casten said until at least 2050.\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nElla French’s brother and the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department have both said that claims French had a child and recently returned from maternity leave are inaccurate. She had no children, her brother said.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nDavis highlighted the fact that then-House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving requested approval from Pelosi before greenlighting the Capitol police chief’s request to call in the National Guard.\\nBut Davis\\xa0ignored a critical detail: the decision to approve that request and call for backup was not Irving’s call alone.\\nIt was made in conjunction with the Senate sergeant-at-arms, who reports to the Senate majority leader. At the time, that was Mitch McConnell.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nOn May 17, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released guidance specifying\\xa0states can\\xa0use money from the American Rescue Plan Act to restore their unemployment funds\\xa0to pre-pandemic levels.\\nLater that month, many states were already making plans to use ARPA dollars to bail out their depleted unemployment funds.\\nSo we asked Pritzker's office what he\\xa0meant when he said using ARPA aid to help address Illinois' unemployment fund deficit was prohibited under federal rules. A\\xa0spokesperson told us the governor misspoke.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nLast year, Illinois created a program offering Medicaid-like benefits to noncitizens age 65 and up who would qualify for a similar\\xa0program under Medicaid but for their immigration status.\\nThis year, lawmakers created a program set to launch next spring that will allow noncitizens over 55 to apply for benefits identical to Medicaid provided they would meet the qualifications for Medicaid itself if not for their immigrant status.\\nA 55-year-old undocumented immigrant living in Illinois would still need to meet the same income criteria as a 55-year-old citizen applying to Medicaid in order to qualify for benefits.\\nBryant drew an inaccurate comparison\\xa0since there’s no scenario in which a U.S. citizen residing in Illinois\\xa0would fail to qualify for Medicaid\\xa0as long as they fell within the proper income range.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nLast year, the Circuit Court of Cook County did suspend jury trials amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nContrary to what Lightfoot claimed, however, the county’s criminal courts have continued their other operations over the past 15 months, and even jury trials started up again this March.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nExperts pointed\\xa0to multiple metrics by which to compare how \"clean\" coal plants are, but federal data shows Prairie State did\\xa0not come out at or\\xa0near the top on any of them.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nRepublicans in the Illinois General Assembly filed and promoted legislation aimed at creating an independent redistricting commission this session.\\nPritzker cited creating an independent panel via legislation as one of the ways lawmakers could have tried for an independent map.\\nWhether or not the GOP plan would have held up in court, it’s clear Republican lawmakers made at least some effort to create a redistricting commission not controlled by lawmakers.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\nMartwick pointed to surveys, non-binding city referendums and House floor votes all overwhelmingly favoring an elected board.\\n\\n\\nSeveral older polls Martwick did not mention garnered similar results, as did a vote on a modified version of his plan in the state Senate.\\n\\n\\nA recent House vote on the measure\\xa0also gained majority approval.\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nDurbin's office told us he meant to refer to the entire state, rather than just Chicagoland. Most lead pipes in Illinois are found in Chicago and surrounding counties.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnlike Illinois, which requires water systems to report how many pipes are or may be lead, there’s no national inventory to use for comparison.\\n\\n\\nThe national survey estimates cited by the federal government are broad, and both Illinois’ and Chicago’s estimated share of those totals varies considerably depending on which end of the range is used.\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nThe package allows spending not only on public health but also on the economic impact of the pandemic as well as government services and infrastructure.\\nBut it still contains two big restrictions: the money cannot pay down pensions or fill in holes created by tax cuts.\\nState and local governments also have to report how they spend the funds, and if they are found in violation must pay the money back.\\n\\n']\n"
